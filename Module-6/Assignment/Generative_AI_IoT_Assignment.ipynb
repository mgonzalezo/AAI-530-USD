Core network elements generate massive volumes of telemetry data covering device attach procedures, session management, data throughput, and power optimization features. Human operators struggle to quickly identify issues affecting IoT device connectivity and performance from raw numerical metrics.\n\n**Solution**: An automated system that:\n1. Collects 24-hour aggregated metrics from NB-IoT Core network elements (MME, S-GW, P-GW, HSS)\n2. Structures the data in JSON format\n3. Sends the data to a generative AI model via API\n4. Receives a natural language summary highlighting critical issues, trends, and recommended actions\n\n**Benefits**:\n- Reduces time to identify IoT connectivity issues from hours to seconds\n- Makes technical Core network metrics accessible to non-technical stakeholders\n- Provides actionable recommendations for IoT device performance optimization\n- Enables early detection of capacity constraints or service degradation\n- Monitors power-saving features (PSM, eDRX) critical for battery-powered IoT devices\n\nThis type of AI-powered reporting is increasingly used in IoT Core network telemetry applications across industries including smart cities, utilities, agriculture, asset tracking, and industrial monitoring."

However, 2 critical and 7 major alerts \nrequire immediate attention, primarily related to authentication failures on MME-03 and interface utilization \non PGW-02. Power optimization features (PSM, eDRX) show strong adoption at 75% and 64% respectively, indicating \neffective battery life extension for IoT devices.\n\n## Key Performance Metrics\n\nPerforming Well:\n- PDN Connection Success Rate: 99.14% (exceeds 99% target)\n- Session Drop Rate: 0.08% (well below 0.1% threshold)\n- Average Attach Duration: 3.45 seconds (within 4 second target)\n- MME CPU Utilization: 42.3% average (healthy, below 60% threshold)\n- Device Growth: 2.8% week-over-week (sustainable growth)\n\nRequires Attention:\n- Attach Success Rate: 98.09% (below 98% target, marginal)\n- Authentication Failures: 890 failures (needs investigation)\n- S-GW-05 Session Setup Time: 4.2s average (exceeds 2s target)\n- PGW-02 SGi Interface: 78% utilization (approaching saturation)\n\n## Critical Issues\n\nCRITICAL - Immediate Action Required:\n\n1. MME-03: High Authentication Failure Rate\n   - Issue: 8.2% authentication failure rate affecting 4,830 devices over 6.4 hours\n   - Impact: IoT devices unable to attach to network, service interruption\n   - Root Cause: Likely HSS synchronization issue or incorrect device credentials\n   - Action: Immediately investigate HSS-MME communication; verify authentication vectors; \n     check for credential provisioning errors\n\nMAJOR Issues:\n\n2. PGW-02: Elevated SGi Interface Utilization\n   - Issue: 78% SGi interface utilization for 3.2 hours\n   - Impact: Potential throughput degradation for IoT data transmission to external networks\n   - Action: Monitor for continued growth; prepare to activate additional PGW capacity or \n     redistribute traffic load\n\n3. S-GW-05: Session Setup Delays\n   - Issue: Average 4.2 second session setup time, affecting 12,450 sessions over 2.8 hours\n   - Impact: Delayed IoT device connectivity, increased battery drain during connection attempts\n   - Action: Investigate S5 interface latency; check S-GW-05 resource utilization; review \n     recent configuration changes\n\n## IoT Device Trends\n\nDevice Population:\n- Total Registered Devices: 2,847,630\n- Active Devices (24h): 1,923,450 (67.5% activity rate)\n- New Registrations: 12,340 devices\n- Deregistrations: 8,920 devices\n- Net Growth: +3,420 devices daily\n\nPower Optimization Adoption:\n- PSM (Power Saving Mode): 2,156,780 devices (75.7% adoption)\n- eDRX (Extended Discontinuous Reception): 1,834,920 devices (64.4% adoption)\n- Devices in Idle Mode: 87.3% (excellent power efficiency)\n- Average PSM Timer: 24 hours (optimal for infrequent reporting applications)\n- Average eDRX Cycle: 163.84 seconds (balanced between latency and power saving)\n\nCoverage Enhancement Distribution:\n- CE Level 0 (Good Coverage): 68.4% of devices\n- CE Level 1 (Moderate Coverage): 24.3% of devices\n- CE Level 2 (Deep Coverage): 7.3% of devices\n\nAnalysis: Strong power optimization adoption indicates successful battery life extension for IoT \ndevices. The 7.3% of devices in deep coverage (CE Level 2) should be monitored for potential \ncoverage improvements through additional base stations or antenna optimization.\n\nCapacity Status:\n- MME Capacity Utilization: 42% (ample headroom)\n- Gateway Capacity Utilization: 45% (ample headroom)\n- Estimated Days to Capacity: 120 days at current 2.8% weekly growth rate\n\n## Recommendations\n\nImmediate (Next 24 Hours):\n1. Escalate MME-03 authentication failure investigation to Core engineering team\n2. Analyze HSS logs for authentication vector generation issues\n3. Verify device credential provisioning for affected IMSI ranges\n4. Implement temporary traffic offload from PGW-02 to PGW-01/03\n\nShort-term (Next 7 Days):\n5. Conduct detailed performance analysis of S-GW-05 session setup latency\n6. Review recent MME-03 software updates or configuration changes that may correlate with \n   authentication failures\n7. Implement automated alerting for authentication failure rate exceeding 3%\n8. Schedule capacity planning review for PGW SGi interfaces\n\nStrategic (Next 30-60 Days):\n9. Plan PGW capacity expansion to address growing SGi utilization (add PGW-05)\n10. Evaluate HSS redundancy and failover mechanisms to prevent single-point authentication issues\n11. Analyze CE Level 2 device locations for potential coverage enhancement opportunities\n12. Continue monitoring device growth trend; current 120-day capacity runway provides adequate \n    planning time for MME/Gateway expansion\n\n---\n\nNext Report: February 18, 2026  \nOn-Call Engineer: Contact IoT Core NOC for escalations\n```\n\nThis report demonstrates how generative AI transforms raw NB-IoT Core telemetry data into actionable \nbusiness intelligence for network operations teams managing millions of IoT devices."
