    "\n",
    "### IoT Application: Automated RAN Network Health Reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "This application demonstrates how generative AI can transform raw telemetry data from 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) IoT sensors into human-readable daily health reports for network operations teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Network operations centers monitor thousands of base stations generating millions of metrics daily. Human operators struggle to quickly identify critical issues and trends from raw numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: An automated system that:\n",
    "1. Collects 24-hour aggregated metrics from RAN IoT sensors (cell towers)\n",
    "2. Structures the data in JSON format\n",
    "3. Sends the data to a generative AI model via API\n",
    "4. Receives a natural language summary highlighting critical issues, trends, and recommended actions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits**:\n",
    "- Reduces time to identify network issues from hours to seconds\n",
    "- Makes technical metrics accessible to non-technical stakeholders\n",
    "- Provides actionable recommendations based on industry best practices\n",
    "- Enables early warning of capacity or performance problems\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of AI-powered reporting is increasingly used in IoT telemetry applications across industries including telecommunications, industrial IoT, smart cities, and energy management systems."

    "\n",
    "The Metro-West-Cluster-01 network is operating at **satisfactory** levels overall, with 99.87% coverage availability and strong average throughput of 485.3 Mbps. However, **3 critical and 12 major alerts** require immediate attention, primarily related to resource utilization approaching capacity thresholds. Capacity planning should be prioritized as 34 cells are operating above 80% resource utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Performance Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "**✓ Performing Well:**\n",
    "- **Throughput**: 485.3 Mbps average (exceeds 400 Mbps target)\n",
    "- **Latency**: 12.4 ms average (within 15 ms target)\n",
    "- **Packet Loss**: 0.18% average (below 0.5% threshold)\n",
    "- **Coverage Availability**: 99.87% (excellent)\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠ Requires Attention:**\n",
    "- **CPU Utilization**: 67.2% average approaching 75% threshold (34 cells above 80%)\n",
    "- **Resource Block Utilization**: 73.8% indicating high demand\n",
    "- **Handover Success Rate**: 97.2% (below 98% target)\n",
    "- **Call Drop Rate**: 0.45% (acceptable but near 0.5% limit)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Critical Issues\n",

    "**🔴 Critical (Immediate Action Required):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CELL-089: Sustained High CPU Utilization**\n",
    "   - **Issue**: CPU utilization at 94.2% for 8.3 hours\n",
    "   - **Impact**: Risk of service degradation, dropped connections\n",
    "   - **Action**: Immediate investigation; consider load balancing or traffic offload to neighboring cells\n",
    "\n",
    "**🟠 Major Issues:**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **CELL-156: Elevated Packet Loss**\n",
    "   - **Issue**: 2.1% packet loss rate for 4.7 hours\n",
    "   - **Impact**: Degraded user experience, potential video buffering, VoIP quality issues\n",
    "   - **Action**: Check backhaul connection integrity; investigate interference sources\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **CELL-223: Handover Failures**\n",
    "   - **Issue**: 12% handover failure rate for 2.1 hours\n",
    "   - **Impact**: Dropped calls during mobility, poor user experience in cell boundaries\n",
    "   - **Action**: Verify neighbor cell configuration; check antenna alignment and coverage overlap\n",
    "\n",
    "## Capacity and Trends\n",
    "\n",
    "**Capacity Status:**\n",
    "- **34 cells** (13.8% of network) operating above 80% resource utilization\n",
    "- **Week-over-week growth**: +3.2% in resource utilization\n",
    "- **Trend**: Increasing demand (sustained upward trajectory)\n",
    "- **Estimated time to capacity**: Approximately 45 days at current growth rate\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis**: The consistent 3.2% weekly growth indicates strong subscriber growth or increased per-user data consumption. Without intervention, capacity constraints will begin affecting service quality within 6 weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Immediate (Next 24 Hours):**\n",
    "1. Investigate and resolve CELL-089 CPU overload condition\n",
    "2. Deploy field technician to CELL-156 to diagnose packet loss source\n",
    "3. Reconfigure handover parameters for CELL-223 and neighbor cells\n",
    "\n",
    "**Short-term (Next 7 Days):**\n",
    "4. Review alarm escalation procedures - 99 total alerts (3 critical, 12 major) suggest potential systemic issues\n",
    "5. Implement automated load balancing for cells exceeding 80% utilization\n",
    "6. Schedule proactive maintenance for cells showing degraded handover performance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategic (Next 30-45 Days):**\n",
    "7. **Capacity Expansion Required**: Begin planning for additional cell sites or carrier upgrades to address 45-day capacity timeline\n",
    "8. Consider implementing dynamic spectrum sharing or carrier aggregation in high-demand areas\n",
    "9. Evaluate deploying small cells in hotspot areas to offload traffic from macro cells\n",
